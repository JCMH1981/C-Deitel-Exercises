/*C How to Program, 6/E, Deitel & Deitel.
   
Solution of exercise 2.20:
(Diameter, Circumference and Area of a Circle) Write a program that reads in 
the radius of a circle and prints the circle's diameter, circumference and 
area. Use the constant value 3.14159 for Ï€. Perform each of these calculations 
inside the printf statement(s) and use the conversion specifier %f. [Note: In 
this chapter, we have discussed only integer constants and variables. In 
Chapter 3 we'll discuss floating-point numbers, i.e., values that can have 
decimal points.]
